The Atom Publishing Protocol is an application-level protocol for
publishing and editing entries in an Atom Feed.

The protocol's design centers around sending and receiving XML
representations of the resources. The Atom protocol server is expected
to maintain these collections of entries, respond to requests for
creating, retrieving, and updating them, and manage ancillary XML
representations that describe the services available to clients.

These are all things that MarkLogic Server was designed to do.

I decided to see how easy it would be to implement a fully conformant
Atom Publishing Protocol server in XQuery on top of MarkLogic Server.
The answer: remarkably easy. The entire implementation of the core
server is less than 2000 lines of XQuery.

This distribution includes that core implementation plus a very tiny
weblog application designed to demonstrate how it could be used.

There seems to be an unfortunate amount of variability in support for
AtomPub clients and servers. This server seems to be conformant,
though some clients have trouble with multiple collections, so you
might have to turn them off.

If you have any trouble, please let me know.
